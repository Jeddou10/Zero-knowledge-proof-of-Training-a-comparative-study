# Zero-knowledge-proof-of-Training-a-comparative-study

The paper explores Zero-Knowledge Proof of Training (zkPoT) as a way to verify machine learning model training without revealing sensitive data or model parameters. It compares three non-interactive zero-knowledge protocols—zkSNARKs, zkSTARKs, and Bulletproofs—based on their proof size, computational efficiency, scalability, and security. The study concludes with optimization proposals to improve performance and support advanced AI applications like federated learning and decentralized AI.
